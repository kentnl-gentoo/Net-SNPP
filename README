Net::SNPP was previously part of the libnet distribution. But has now
been separated out to a distribution of its own.

INSTALLATION

Installation is the same as any other MakeMaker packaged distribution
from CPAN.

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make install

If you are on a machine where Makemaker does not run, or you do
not have a copy of make, then you can simply copy the contents of
the lib directory into your perl installation library directory.
However you will need to have Net::Cmd from libnet installed
